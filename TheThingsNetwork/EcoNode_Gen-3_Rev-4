I've set up an application and device in TTN and added you as
collaborator. Can you access this?

I'm using Arduino-LMIC as library for TTN on my nodes. You can get it
from here https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic
<https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic>

Download and set up Arduino IDE if you haven't done yet. To use the
EcoNode board simply select "Arduino Zero (native USB)" as board in
Arduino. Then you're good to go.

You can also use another IDE, like Platform.io, but Arduino might be the
most familiar one.

I've attached a basic sketch that will work with the EcoNode. It uses
the DEVUI, DEV-EUI and APPKEY of the TTN application from above. Each
node must use their own, so if you want to add more nodes, create more
devices in TTN.
Also use the attached lmic_project_config and place it in the
arduino-lmic directory (overwrite the existing file)
